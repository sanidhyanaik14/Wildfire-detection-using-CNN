# Wildfire detection using CNN
This project is an AI-driven web application designed to detect wildfires from satellite or aerial imagery using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It integrates deep learning with a user-friendly web interface built using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions about wildfire presence.

# Key Features:
✅ CNN-based Fire Detection Model trained to recognize wildfire patterns in images
✅ Flask Web Framework to serve the AI model and handle image uploads
✅ Frontend UI using HTML/CSS for easy interaction
✅ Real-time predictions with visual results

# Technologies Used:

- Python – Core programming and backend logic  
- Flask – Web framework to handle routing, form submission, and rendering  
- TensorFlow / Keras – Loading and using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network model  
- NumPy – For image array manipulation and model prediction formatting  
- HTML/CSS – Frontend user interface for uploading images and viewing results

# Wildfire-detection-using-CNN
This project is an AI-driven web application designed to detect wildfires from satellite or aerial imagery using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It integrates deep learning with a user-friendly web interface built using Flask, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions about wildfire presence.
